    <h1>Luxury Picnic Ideas for Ottawa Parks & Backyards (2026 Guide)</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>The luxury picnic trend has fully arrived in Ottawa — and it's showing no signs of slowing down in 2026. What
        began as a social-media-driven aesthetic has evolved into one of the most popular celebration formats for
        <strong>bridal showers, anniversaries, birthday parties, and milestone proposals</strong> across the city.</p>

    <h2>What Is a Luxury Picnic?</h2>
    <p>A luxury picnic is a styled, intimate outdoor gathering that replaces the classic checkered blanket with a
        curated, design-forward setup. Think: low boho tables with plush floor cushions, candles glowing in glass
        holders, overflowing charcuterie and floral arrangements, and a cohesive colour palette running from the
        tablerunner to the balloon garland.</p>

    <h2>Best Spots for a Luxury Picnic in Ottawa</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gatineau Park</strong> – Stunning wilderness backdrop, especially in spring and summer.</li>
        <li><strong>Commissioners Park</strong> – Lakeside views and the iconic Dows Lake setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Strathcona Park</strong> – Lush greenery close to the Rideau River. Beautiful in warmer months.</li>
        <li><strong>Major's Hill Park</strong> – Right in the heart of Ottawa with Parliament Hill as your backdrop.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Private Backyards</strong> – For a more intimate and private setup, your backyard (or a family
            member's estate) can be perfectly transformed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Rent for Your Luxury Picnic</h2>
    <p>The beauty of renting is that all the setup and teardown is handled, so you can focus on enjoying the moment. For
        a luxury picnic, popular rental items include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Low boho picnic tables and floor cushions or poufs</li>
        <li>Table runners in natural linen, macramé, or velvet</li>
        <li>Candle holders, lanterns, and fairy light strings</li>
        <li>Vases and bud vases for floral arrangements</li>
        <li>Decorative plates, glasses, and napkins</li>
        <li>A floral or balloon backdrop for photos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Seasonal Picnic Styling Tips for Ottawa</h2>
    <p><strong>Spring & Summer:</strong> Bright florals, organic linens, pastel tones, and fresh floral garlands work
        beautifully in Ottawa's warm months. Plan for a backup in case of afternoon showers — parks can be
        unpredictable.</p>
    <p><strong>Fall:</strong> Embrace rich warm tones like burnt orange, deep burgundy, and gold. Dried floral
        arrangements, terracotta vases, and cable-knit throws add warmth and texture.</p>
    <p><strong>Winter / Indoor:</strong> Yes, luxury indoor "picnics" are a thing! Set up in your living room or a
        rented event space with cozy throws, string lights, and floor cushions for a hygge-inspired celebration.</p>
