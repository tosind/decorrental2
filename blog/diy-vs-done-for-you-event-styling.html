    <h1>DIY vs Done-For-You: Which Event Styling Option Is Right for You?</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>At Ottawa Decor Rentals, every one of our bundles offers two booking modes: <strong>DIY Pickup</strong> and
        <strong>Done-For-You (DFY)</strong>. It's one of our most-loved features, because every client has different
        needs, budgets, and timelines. But how do you choose? Let's break it down.</p>

    <h2>What Is DIY Pickup?</h2>
    <p>With our DIY option, you pick up your rental items from our Ottawa location, set them up yourself at your venue,
        and return everything after your event. You have full creative control over the setup, and this option comes at
        a notably lower price point.</p>

    <h2>What Is Done-For-You (DFY)?</h2>
    <p>Our DFY service means our professional styling team delivers everything to your venue, sets it up completely
        according to your vision, and returns to tear it all down after the event is over. You don't lift a finger —
        except to enjoy yourself.</p>

    <h2>Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Factor</th>
            <th>DIY Pickup</th>
            <th>Done-For-You</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cost</td>
            <td>Lower (you provide labour)</td>
            <td>Higher (includes delivery + setup + teardown)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Flexibility</td>
            <td>Very flexible — you control the styling</td>
            <td>Collaborative — you guide, we execute</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stress Level</td>
            <td>Moderate (requires coordination on event day)</td>
            <td>Low — relax and enjoy your event</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Best For</td>
            <td>Couples or hosts with helping hands available</td>
            <td>Busy couples and those wanting zero day-of hassle</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Logistics</td>
            <td>You transport and return items</td>
            <td>We handle all delivery, setup, and collection</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Who Should Choose DIY?</h2>
    <p>DIY is a great fit if you're hosting a smaller, backyard event where setup logistics are simple, or if you have a
        team of friends and family who are eager to help. It's also ideal if you want to keep costs down and you're
        comfortable with a bit of event-day coordination.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Choose Done-For-You?</h2>
    <p>If it's your wedding day, a milestone birthday, a corporate function, or any event where you simply <em>cannot
            afford</em> to be running around setting up tablescapes, DFY is absolutely worth the investment. Our team
        ensures every vase, candle, and linen is placed exactly as planned, so that when your guests walk in the room,
        they're instantly transported.</p>
