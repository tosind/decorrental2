    <h1>Best Wedding Venues in Ottawa & the Surrounding Area (2026)</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>Ottawa and the surrounding region are home to some of Ontario and Quebec's most breathtaking wedding venues —
        from Gatineau's rolling hills to Rideau-Valley estate farms and Ottawa's own historic architecture. As a decor
        rental supplier who regularly works across the region, we've styled events at many of these locations and have
        some informed opinions to share.</p>

    <h2>Urban Ottawa Venues</h2>

    <h3>The Château Laurier</h3>
    <p>For couples seeking old-world grandeur, the Fairmont Château Laurier remains an iconic choice. Its castle-like
        stone exterior and opulent interior ballrooms pair magnificently with classic romantic decor — think tall gold
        candelabras, crystal glassware, and dramatic floral centrepieces.</p>

    <h3>The Cartier Place Suite Hotel</h3>
    <p>A more boutique downtown option, popular for intimate receptions and cocktail-style events. Its modern interior
        receives our velvet lounge furniture and boho-contemporary tablescapes very well.</p>

    <h3>The RA Centre</h3>
    <p>A versatile event centre with multiple hall sizes for groups of any scale, with excellent kitchen facilities and
        proximity to convenient Ottawa transit.</p>

    <h2>Outdoor & Garden Venues Near Ottawa</h2>

    <h3>Estate Farms in Manotick & Almonte</h3>
    <p>The villages of Manotick and Almonte, within 30–45 minutes of downtown Ottawa, are home to several private
        estates and heritage farms that host weddings. These are perfect for maximalist outdoor garden reception setups
        with floral arches, farm tables, and string lighting.</p>

    <h3>Gatineau Park Pavilions</h3>
    <p>Gatineau Park on the Quebec side of the Ottawa River offers several natural and semi-covered pavilions that serve
        as stunning ceremony venues, especially in summer and early fall when the foliage is dramatic.</p>

    <h3>Rideau Valley Properties</h3>
    <p>Properties along the Rideau Waterway offer sweeping riverside and lakeside backdrops. Rustic barn weddings
        flourish here, perfectly complemented by our farmhouse and boho styling inventory.</p>

    <h2>What to Ask Your Venue Before You Book Rentals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the load-in and load-out window for vendors?</li>
        <li>Are candles and open flames permitted?</li>
        <li>Is there a preferred vendor list we need to adhere to?</li>
        <li>Is there parking for our delivery vehicle?</li>
        <li>What are the backup plans for inclement weather?</li>
    </ul>
