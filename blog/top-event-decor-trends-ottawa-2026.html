    <h1>Top Event Decor Trends in Ottawa for 2026</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>Planning a celebration in Ottawa this year? Whether you're organizing a wedding, a graduation party, a bridal
        shower, or a corporate gala, the world of event decor is evolving beautifully in 2026. As Ottawa's premier
        rental supplier, we've seen these trends first-hand and we're excited to share them with you.</p>

    <h2>1. Romantic Maximalism</h2>
    <p>Gone are the days of stark minimalism ruling the event space. In 2026, Ottawa couples and event hosts are
        embracing <strong>romantic maximalism</strong> — layering florals, candles, textures, and statement pieces to
        create lush, deeply immersive environments. Think dramatic floral arches, cascading candlelight, velvet linens,
        and multiple decorative focal points throughout a venue.</p>

    <h2>2. Sustainable & Organic Materials</h2>
    <p>Ottawa's environmentally-conscious community is pushing for greener celebrations. This means renting over buying
        is more popular than ever (a great reason to choose decor rentals!), and couples are choosing organic-looking
        greenery, dried pampas grass, terracotta pottery, and naturally woven runners over mass-produced plastic decor.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Bold Colour Palettes Making a Comeback</h2>
    <p>Sage and beige have had their moment. The 2026 Ottawa event scene is embracing <strong>bold, saturated colour
            palettes</strong>: deep coral, cobalt blue, forest green, and warm terracotta are appearing on tables and
        arches alike. Paired with gold or brass metallic accents, these colours create a richly memorable aesthetic.</p>

    <h2>4. Personalized Tablescapes</h2>
    <p>Guests are no longer satisfied with generic table settings. Hosts are working with stylists to create highly
        personalized and curated tablescapes — custom name cards, locally-sourced floral arrangements, and mix-and-match
        charger plates that tell a visual story unique to the couple or host.</p>
    <blockquote>"A table setting should feel like a piece of art that your guests get to sit inside." — Ottawa Decor

    <h2>5. Luxury Outdoor Experiences</h2>
    <p>Ottawa's stunning parks, golf estates, and riverside locations are perfect for elevated outdoor events. Luxury
        picnics, outdoor receptions in gatineau and Rideau-area estates, and garden parties complete with lounge
        furniture and lantern lighting are among the fastest-growing requests we receive.</p>

    <h2>6. Interactive Decor Elements</h2>
    <p>Modern events are incorporating decor that guests can interact with — floral photo backdrops, lounge vignettes
        with plush seating and coffee table books, or even self-serve cocktail stations styled with bespoke barware and
        greenery. These features serve double duty as decor and entertainment.</p>
