    <h1>The Ultimate Guide to Wedding Rentals in Ottawa (2026)</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>Planning a wedding in Ottawa is an exciting journey — and one of the best decisions you can make is to
        <strong>rent your decor</strong> rather than buying it. Renting saves money, reduces waste, and gives you access
        to a higher quality of items than you could typically afford to purchase outright. This guide covers everything
        you need to know.</p>

    <h2>Why Rent Your Wedding Decor?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Rental prices are a fraction of the retail cost, especially for items like
            candelabras, charger plates, or lounge furniture.</li>
        <li><strong>Less stress:</strong> The rental company handles clean-up and collection — you don't have to figure
            out what to do with 200 charger plates after your wedding.</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-friendly:</strong> Reusable items mean less waste in Ottawa's landfills.</li>
        <li><strong>Wider selection:</strong> Access a professional curator's inventory of premium items you'd never
            find at a big-box store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Can You Rent for a Wedding in Ottawa?</h2>
    <p>Virtually everything decorative can be rented. Here's a breakdown of the most popular categories:</p>

    <h3>Linens & Table Decor</h3>
    <p>Tablecloths, runners, napkins, charger plates, candle holders, vases, and place card holders. Linen choices alone
        can dramatically transform the look of a reception room.</p>

    <h3>Lounge & Seating Furniture</h3>
    <p>Velvet sofas, accent chairs, love seats, ottomans, and coffee tables are increasingly popular for creating
        elegant cocktail-hour lounge vignettes or photo-worthy corners at your reception.</p>

    <h3>Ceremony Arches & Stands</h3>
    <p>From geometric gold frames to rustic wooden arches, these pieces form the visual centrepiece of your ceremony
        space and pair beautifully with fresh or dried floral arrangements.</p>

    <h3>Lighting & Ambiance</h3>
    <p>Candelabras, lanterns, pillar candles, votive holders, fairy lights, and string light arrangements create warmth
        and romance that no venue lighting system can replicate.</p>

    <h2>How Far in Advance Should You Book?</h2>
    <p>In Ottawa, popular wedding dates (especially May–October Saturdays) book up quickly. We recommend reaching out to
        your rental supplier <strong>at least 3–6 months in advance</strong> to secure your preferred items. Our
        most-requested bundles, like the <a href="/bundles.html">Micro Wedding Luxe and Garden Romance packages</a>, are
        particularly high-demand.</p>

    <h2>DIY Pickup vs. Full Styling Service</h2>
    <p>At Ottawa Decor Rentals, we offer two ways to work with us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DIY Pickup:</strong> You collect and return the items yourself. More hands-on, but very
            cost-effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Done-For-You (DFY):</strong> Our team delivers, sets up, and tears down. Best if you want to enjoy
            your day completely stress-free.</li>
    </ul>
