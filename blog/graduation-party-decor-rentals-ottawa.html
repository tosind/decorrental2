    <h1>Graduation Party Decor Rentals in Ottawa – Class of 2026</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>The Class of 2026 has worked incredibly hard — and they deserve a celebration to match. Whether you're planning a
        backyard graduation party for your child, hosting a gathering for multiple grads, or organizing a school prom
        after-party, <strong>the right decor makes all the difference</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Outdoor Graduation Party Ideas in Ottawa</h2>
    <p>Ottawa summers are beautiful, and a well-styled outdoor graduation party in a backyard or park is one of the most
        popular cel formats we see in June and July. Consider a draped tent or gazebo anchor with string lights and
        hanging florals, long farm tables with linen runners, and a custom photo backdrop featuring the grad's name and
        graduation year.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>String lights and globe lanterns strung overhead create an instant magical atmosphere as dusk arrives</li>
        <li>A "Congrats Grad" marquee letter display or signage station doubles as a photo op</li>
        <li>A dessert or cake table styled with florals, tier risers, and coordinated linens</li>
        <li>Lounge seating areas with poufs and low tables for guests to relax and mingle</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Indoor Graduation Party Styling</h2>
    <p>For parties in event halls, basements, or rented community spaces, we recommend focusing on three key zones: the
        <strong>main dining area</strong>, the <strong>dessert / cake table</strong>, and a <strong>photo backdrop
            wall</strong>. These three zones will capture 90% of your photos and create the most lasting memories.</p>

    <h2>Popular Grad Party Colour Themes in Ottawa (2026)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Black and Gold:</strong> A classic and sophisticated grad palette. Black table linens, gold charger
            plates, gold balloon clusters, and geometric gold candle holders.</li>
        <li><strong>School Colours:</strong> Lean into school pride with a palette built around the grad's university or
            high school colours.</li>
        <li><strong>Tropical Vibes:</strong> Bright and celebratory — perfect for a summer outdoor setup with palm leaf
            accents, bright florals, and rattan charger plates.</li>
        <li><strong>Soft Luxe:</strong> Dusty rose, champagne, and gold for a more elegant and mature celebration,
            especially popular for university graduations.</li>
    </ul>
