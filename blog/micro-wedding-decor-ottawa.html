    <h1>Micro-Wedding Decor Ideas for Intimate Ottawa Celebrations</h1>
    <p class="meta">Published February 2026 | Ottawa Decor Rentals</p>

    <p>The micro-wedding movement is not just a trend — in Ottawa, it has become a full-fledged lifestyle choice. With
        guest lists of 5 to 30 people, micro-weddings allow couples to <strong>invest more in quality, intimacy, and
            meaningful details</strong> rather than capacity. And when it comes to decor, having a smaller guest count
        actually opens the door to more lavish, intentional styling.</p>

    <h2>Why Micro-Weddings Work So Well in Ottawa</h2>
    <p>Ottawa's landscape offers dozens of stunning intimate wedding settings — from private estate gardens in Almonte,
        Russell, and Manotick to historic stone churches, boutique hotels, and Gatineau park clearings. These intimate
        venues don't need to accommodate 200 guests, which means they're uniquely suited to micro-wedding aesthetics.
    </p>

    <h2>Ceremony Setup Ideas for Micro-Weddings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>A dramatic floral arch:</strong> When you only have a small ceremony area to fill, a lush,
            over-the-top floral arch becomes the statement piece. Rent a geometric gold or rustic wooden arch and pair
            it with cascading blooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Chiavari or ghost chairs:</strong> A small row of elegant chairs arranged on either side creates
            that timeless processional feel without needing a long aisle.</li>
        <li><strong>Lanterns and candles:</strong> Line your ceremony path with lanterns or pillar candles in glass
            hurricanes for warmth and drama.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reception Table Styling for Small Gatherings</h2>
    <p>With only one or two dining tables to style, your micro-wedding tablescape can be absolutely extraordinary. This
        is the moment to go all-in with layered linens, elaborate florals, multiple types of candle holders, and
        hand-written place cards.</p>
    <blockquote>"A micro-wedding should feel like the most beautiful dinner party ever hosted in someone's home — but in
        a magical setting." — Ottawa Decor Rentals</blockquote>

    <h2>Don't Forget the Lounge & Photo Spaces</h2>
    <p>With a small guest count, you have the opportunity to create memorable, magazine-worthy vignettes throughout your
        venue. A velvet loveseat draped in florals makes for a stunning sweetheart seat. A cosy lounge area with poufs,
        ottomans, and coffee table books becomes the gathering spot most guests will gravitate toward.</p>
